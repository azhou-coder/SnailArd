# SnailArd
Sideways Snail - Arduino Code
My intent with this project is to create a responsive piece that reacts quickly when something is close by and reacts slowly when something is far away. I decided to focus on the movement of a snailâ€™s antennas. The antennas are used to determine orientation and for detecting scents. A snail would sense an object that is nearby and actively determine what it is. However, the snail would not be motivated to determine the details about an object that is far away. 
	The house for the electronics is a small cardboard box that was used to deliver small items. I reused it because it has a magnetic lid and the cardboard material allows me to modify it. I cut out rectangular holes with an Exacto knife in order to accommodate the sensor and battery. The antennas are made out of pins and taped to the servo motor. The shell is 3-D printed and the file was sourced from Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17894 ). The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of the object (greater or less than 100) and the servo motor moves the antennas.
